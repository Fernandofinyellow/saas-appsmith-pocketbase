# SaaS App with Appsmith and Pocketbase

- This is a template to build a full SaaS application with a low-code environment inside Appsmith and a database powered by Pocketbase.io
- If you want to build a SaaS service, but are scared of all the code you need to produce to get a basic interface with users, database, etc., this is for you.

# Features

- Pocketbase database with users, content, etc.
- User registration, user login
- Full SaaS authentication against Pocketbase
- Dynamic menu configured inside Pocketbase
- Email verification (if you have SMTP configured in Pocketbase)

# Getting Started

- Install Pocketbase via instructions in the [pocketbase directory](https://github.com/jakubsuchy/saas-appsmith-pocketbase/tree/main/pocketbase)
- Go to Appsmith.com, click Create New -> Import
- Import from file and use the file in the [appsmith directory](https://github.com/jakubsuchy/saas-appsmith-pocketbase/tree/main/appsmith)
- After you import, you will be asked to update the Datasource Pocketbase. Change the URL to the URL of your pocketbase install
